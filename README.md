# Pivotal Cloud Foundry Workshop

This workshop will demonstrate various features of Pivotal Cloud Foundry.  Instructions for the workshop can be found in the `docs` directory.

Full, working solution is in the `Complete` directory, starter projects are in the `Starter` directory.  There's a lot of material here, so we actually ended up showing the working solution, then going back to review the code (as time permits).
